# Styling a container.

* in flutter styling happens completely through the arguments you pass to your 
widgets.
  * Unlike CSS, which is an extra language in itself.
* Flutter has no such seperation. A plus point of flutter.
* If you want to give a background color to a column, and column does not 
  accept background color, you will have to wrap it with another widget that 
  accepts the background color.


Adding border radius
```dart
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
border: Border.all(color: Colors.black, width: 2),
```
